### Exercise: Using Middlewares in a Next.js Application

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice using middlewares in a Next.js application to enhance and modify requests and responses in a systematic way.

#### Instructions:

1. Create a custom middleware function in the "middleware" file. For example, you can create a middleware that logs information about incoming requests, such as the request method, URL.

2. Implement the middleware function to run on every request made to your Next.js application.
3. Create a new route in the "app" directory, named "About"

4. Implement the "About" page to respond with a simple message like "Hello, welcome to the website!" for all incoming requests.

5. Test the application.
