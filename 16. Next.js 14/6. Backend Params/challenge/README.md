### Exercise: Handling Backend Parameters in a Next.js Application

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice handling backend parameters and query strings in a Next.js application, allowing students to understand how to work with dynamic server-side data.

#### Instructions:

2. Create a new route in the "api" directory, named "userdetails"

3. Implement server-side parameter handling in the "userdetails" route using (response.params.somedata). Define a parameter in the URL, such as a user ID, which can be accessed as a route parameter.

4. Fetch user data from a API, using the user ID from the parameter to retrieve specific user information.

5. Log the fetched user data.

6. Test the application.
