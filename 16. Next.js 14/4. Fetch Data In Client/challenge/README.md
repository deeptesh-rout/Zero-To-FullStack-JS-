### Exercise: Fetching Data in the Client-Side of a Next.js Application

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice fetching data on the client side in a Next.js application using client-side rendering techniques.

#### Instructions:

2. Create a new route in the "app" directory, named "clientdatafetch"

3. In the "clientdatafetch" route, use Next.js's `useEffect` and `fetch` (or any preferred data fetching method) to retrieve data from a publicly available API, such as the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) or (https://dummyjson.com/products).

4. Display the fetched data on the "clientdatafetch" page. For example, you can display a list of posts, users, or any other relevant data from the API.

5. Ensure that the data fetching and rendering occur on the client side by making the API request in the browser, not during server-side rendering.

6. Test the application.
