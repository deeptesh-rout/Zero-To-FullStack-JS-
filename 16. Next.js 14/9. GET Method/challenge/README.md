### Exercise: Working with the GET Method in a Next.js Application

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice using the HTTP GET method to retrieve data from a server in a Next.js application.

#### Instructions:

1. Create a new folder in the "api" directory, named "getdata"

2. Implement the "getdata" page to make an HTTP GET request to a publicly available API of your choice. You can use a popular public API like the JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) for this exercise.

3. Retrieve data from the API using the GET method. For example, you can retrieve a list of posts or users.

4. Use a postman tool to see all the data coming from that API.
