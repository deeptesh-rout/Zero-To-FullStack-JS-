### Exercise: Creating Basic Layouts in Next.js

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice creating and applying basic layouts in a Next.js application to maintain consistency and structure across multiple pages.

#### Instructions:

1. In your Next.js project, create a new component named "layout.js." This component will serve as the basic layout structure that can be reused across multiple pages.

2. Design the "layout.js" component with a simple structure that includes a header, navigation menu, content area, and a footer. You can use standard HTML and CSS or a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or styled-components to style the layout (if you want to).

3. Create a landing page in the "app" directory, This page will use the "Layout" component.

4. Implement a "Contact" route in the "app" directory, This page will also use the "Layout" component for consistent layout structure.

5. Customize the header, navigation menu, and footer in the "Layout" component to include links to the "Home" and "Contact" pages.

6. Test the application.
