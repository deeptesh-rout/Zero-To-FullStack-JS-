### Exercise: Implementing Conditional Layouts in Next.js

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice creating conditional layouts in a Next.js application, allowing different pages to have distinct layouts based on specific conditions.

#### Instructions:

2. Create two distinct layout components: "StandardLayout.js" and "AlternateLayout.js." Each layout component should have a different structure, styling, or content.

3. Create a new page or modifiy the exisiting one in the "app" directory named "page.js." This page will serve as the landing page for your application.

4. Implement conditional layout selection for the root "page.js". If a specific condition is met (e.g., a user is logged in), use the "AlternateLayout" component; otherwise, use the "StandardLayout" component.

5. Design the "StandardLayout" and "AlternateLayout" components to make them visually distinct.

6. Test the application.
