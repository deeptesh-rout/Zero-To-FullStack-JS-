### Exercise: Using `useRouter` in Next.js

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice using the `useRouter` hook in a Next.js application for programmatic navigation and accessing route information.

#### Instructions:

1. Create two routes: "page1" and "page2".

2. In the "page1" route, create a simple landing page with a message and a button.

3. In the "page2" route, create a second page with information or content.

4. Implement a programmatic navigation from "page1" to "page2" using the `useRouter` hook from Next. When the user clicks a button on "page1," they should be navigated to "page2."

5. Verify that programmatic navigation from "page1" to "page2" works as expected, and that the route information is displayed on "page2."
