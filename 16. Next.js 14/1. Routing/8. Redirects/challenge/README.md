### Exercise: Implementing Redirects in Next.js

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice setting up and managing redirects in a Next.js application to enhance user experience and ensure proper page navigation.

#### Instructions:

1. In your Next.js project, create a custom error page named "404.js" in the "app" directory. This page will serve as the custom 404 error page for your application.

2. Implement redirects for the following scenarios:

- Create a redirection rule that redirects users from the route "/old-page" to the new page "/new-page."
- Create a rule that redirects users from a non-existing route "/non-existing" to the custom 404 error page "404.js."

3. Verify that the redirection from "/old-page" to "/new-page" works as expected, and that accessing a non-existing route redirects users to the custom 404 error page.
