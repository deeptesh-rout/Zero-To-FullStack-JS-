### Exercise: Working with Environment Variables in a Next.js Application

#### Goal:

The goal of this exercise is to practice using environment variables to manage configuration settings and sensitive data in a Next.js application.

#### Instructions:

1. In your Next.js project, create a `.env.local` file to store your environment variables. This file will be used for local development and should not be committed to version control.

2. Define environment variables in the `.env.local` file for NODE_ENV, If it's in the development mode show this message: "App running in the development mode".

3. Access the environment variables in your Next.js application. For example, you can use `process.env.NODE_ENV` to access the API key.
